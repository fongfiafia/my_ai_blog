# Cursor Composer Tutorial

## Overview

Cursor Composer is a powerful tool that supports multi-file editing and complete application generation, significantly enhancing your coding experience. This is one of the key features that sets Cursor apart from other AI programming software.

This tutorial will give you a comprehensive understanding of Cursor Composer and teach you how to use it efficiently.

## What is Cursor Composer?

Cursor Composer is an AI-driven tool integrated into the Cursor editor, breaking the limitations of single-file, single-line editing. It offers the following powerful features:

- Support for editing multiple files simultaneously, improving multitasking efficiency
- Ability to automatically generate a complete application based on advanced instructions
- In-depth understanding of project structure, providing intelligent context support for development
- Interactive optimization and adjustment of auto-generated code

## Opening Composer

When you press `Cmd+I` (note that it's the letter "I," not "L"), the Composer window will open on the right side of the Cursor editor. If you're using an older version of Cursor, Composer will open in the center of your screen.

## Basic Features of Composer

### Editing Multiple Files Simultaneously

In the example below, after I made a modification request, Cursor understood and proactively modified two files for me. This is something other AI programming tools cannot do:

This significant feature is particularly useful for developing a project from scratch. A project typically involves creating, editing, and deleting multiple files, and with just one conversation, Cursor can handle everything for you in one go.

### Context Awareness

A Composer window can be considered as a single conversation. The subsequent messages will be treated as context, helping Cursor understand and develop more effectively.

You can also specify certain files or content to help Cursor understand the project better. Simply click the plus icon or type `@` to reference specific file content.

### Model Selection

You can choose different large language models to interact with. I recommend using **Claude 3.5**, which I consider the best model currently available. It is also the natively supported model in Cursor, making it better integrated and optimized.

### File Management

In Composer, not only can you edit and generate code, but you can also create, delete, or modify files directly. This seamless integration boosts your efficiency during the development process.

## Tips for Using Composer

### Resetting Composer

If Composer is loading slowly and you've ruled out network issues, it is likely because Composer has been open for a long time and accumulated too much context, which can slow down interactions with the large language model.

To restore a smoother experience, I suggest opening a new Composer window by clicking the plus icon in the top right corner to start a new conversation.

### Viewing History

To review previous conversations, click the clock icon in the top right corner. This allows you to easily trace back to earlier modifications or ideas.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: If I log out and log in with a new account, will my Composer content be saved?**

**A: Yes, your Composer content will be saved.** Since Cursor Composer syncs data to your account, logging out and logging in with a new account won't erase your conversation history.

## Conclusion

Cursor Composer is a powerful AI-driven tool that greatly enhances your development efficiency, especially when managing multiple files and generating complex applications. With its intelligent context understanding and seamless integration with large language models, you can easily manage and optimize multiple files in your project and quickly generate complete applications. By mastering the techniques in this tutorial, you'll be able to fully harness the power of Cursor Composer and significantly boost your coding productivity.
