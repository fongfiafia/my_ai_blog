   - Fill in your username and email. Note that when verifying a QQ email, the verification code may not display correctly, but using a 126 email works fine. If this issue persists due to policy changes, you may need a VPN. You can refer to this link, which I personally use:

   - You will receive a verification code by email; just enter it.

3. **Account Types**:
   Cursor offers three types of accounts:
   - **Hobby**: Free plan, which includes a two-week Pro trial, 2,000 code completions per month, 50 slow-priority advanced requests, and 200 uses of the Cursor-small model. Cursor-small is a faster model suitable for quick editing tasks.
   
   - **Pro**: $20 per month, including all features from the Hobby plan, with unlimited code completions, 500 fast-priority advanced requests per month, unlimited slow-priority advanced requests, unlimited Cursor-small usage, and 10 daily uses of Claude Opus. High-end models include GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Fast-priority requests are handled first, and any requests exceeding this limit may be queued during high load times.
   
   - **Business**: $40 per user per month, including all Pro plan features and additional centralized billing, administrator usage dashboards, mandatory privacy mode, and OpenAI/Anthropic zero-data retention policies. Privacy mode ensures that code is stored only on the user's device and will not be used for training. Some Cursor features are not supported through API key billing. If the user exceeds the planâ€™s limits, Cursor will prompt for an upgrade.

   Based on personal experience, the Hobby free plan is sufficient for small projects, though there are ways to get around the limitations, such as registering multiple emails. You can check out this article for more details.

   - Cursor will offer a brief introductory tutorial, which you can choose to ignore for now.
