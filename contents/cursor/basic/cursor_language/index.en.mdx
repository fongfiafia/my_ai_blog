# Setting Cursor to Chinese/Other Languages

## Overview

Cursor is developed by a foreign team, so its default language is English. This might be inconvenient for Chinese users, but it can be set to Chinese. This tutorial will show you how to change the language to Chinese.

## Opening the Plugin Platform

Cursor editor allows you to install various plugins to improve efficiency.

We will recommend some very useful free plugins in the future.

To open the plugin marketplace, click the button as shown in the image below:
