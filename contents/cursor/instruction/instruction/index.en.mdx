# Preface

## My View on Cursor
In this AI era, I believe Cursor can greatly empower ordinary people, helping everyone realize their creative ideas and concepts.

> Example: It helped me develop and launch an AI WeChat Mini Program and this blog website

## Our Relationship with Cursor
I believe: Don't just treat Cursor as a programming tool, but also as a teacher. We should learn from each of Cursor's responses. The more you understand, the higher the potential of your creations.

> Example: When developing WeChat Mini Programs, I would ask her about the purpose of each file and response content.
>
> This way I learned that index.wxss is used to control page styles, index.js is for writing logic, and adjusting background color means changing the background-color parameter
>
> The more I know, the more accurate my questions to Cursor become, and I can even make small modifications myself to better match my expectations

## Tips
+ Break down complex problems. If you have many requirements, don't present them all at once. You can split them by page and gradually present your needs, letting Cursor help you implement them step by step.
+ If you're not in a hurry, ask Cursor why it implements things in certain ways and learn from it.
+ When problems occur, let Cursor explain why the error happened and how to fix it
+ Provide examples to Cursor, and it will respond more accurately. For instance, if you want it to call a specific model API interface that's relatively niche and Cursor might not be familiar with, find the API documentation yourself and copy the relevant examples to help it understand
+ To improve the aesthetics of your pages and mini programs, you still need to do necessary programming study. The more you understand, the higher the potential of your creations
