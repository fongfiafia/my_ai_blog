## What Cursor Means to Me
I believe that in the current AI era, Cursor can greatly empower everyone, helping ordinary people realize their creative ideas.

> Example: Helped me develop and launch an AI WeChat Mini Program and this blog website

## Our Relationship with Cursor
I believe: Don't just treat Cursor as a programming tool, but also as a teacher. We should learn from every response from Cursor. The more we understand, the higher the potential of what we can create.

> Example: When developing WeChat Mini Programs, I would ask her about the purpose of each file and response content.
>
> This way I learned that index.wxss is for controlling page styles, index.js is for writing logic, and adjusting background color means changing the background-color parameter.
>
> The more I know, the more accurate my questions to Cursor will be. I can even make small modifications myself to better match my expectations.
