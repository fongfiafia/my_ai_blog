# Cursor Free Access Plan - Low-key Approach

## Overview of Cursor and Pricing

Cursor is a powerful AI programming assistant that offers multiple subscription plans to help developers enhance their productivity. Below are the three main account plans and their pricing:

- **Hobby (Free Plan)**:
  - Includes a 2-week Pro trial period.
  - 2,000 code completions per month.
  - 50 slow priority premium requests per month.
  - 200 uses of the Cursor-small model per month. Cursor-small is a faster model designed for quick editing tasks.

- **Pro ($20/month)**:
  - Includes all features from the Hobby plan, with unlimited code completions.
  - 500 fast priority premium requests per month.
  - Unlimited slow premium requests and unlimited Cursor-small usage.
  - 10 daily uses of Claude Opus with fast priority.
  - Advanced models include GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

- **Business ($40/user/month)**:
  - Includes all features from the Pro plan, plus centralized billing, admin dashboards, mandatory privacy mode, and OpenAI/Anthropic zero data retention policy.
  - Privacy mode ensures code is stored only on the user's device and not used for training.
  - If users exceed their plan limits, Cursor will prompt them to upgrade their plan.

For many independent developers, students, or startup programmers, the $20/month subscription fee might be a bit of a financial strain. Below are some "free access" methods, but we do not encourage using them long-term. Supporting the software by paying for a subscription is important, and if possible, we recommend purchasing the Pro or Business plans.

## Using Gmail to Get Free Access to Cursor - Method 1

Here’s how to get a 14-day free trial of Cursor Pro by using a Gmail account:

1. **Create a new Gmail account**:
   - Visit [Gmail Website](https://www.gmail.com).
   - Click "Create Account."
   - Fill in the required personal information and complete the verification steps.

2. **Register for Cursor using the new Gmail account**:
   - Go to [Cursor Website](https://cursor.sh).
   - Click "Sign Up" or "Get Started."
   - Choose to log in using your Google account.
   - Authorize the use of the newly created Gmail account.

3. **Activate the 14-day free trial**:
   - After logging in, you will automatically receive the 14-day Cursor Pro free trial.
   - Explore and use all the features available in the Pro plan.

4. **Repeat the process**:
   - Once the 14-day trial period ends, you can repeat steps 1-3.
   - By creating a new Gmail account, you can get another 14-day free trial.

## Using Gmail to Get Free Access to Cursor - Method 2

Constantly switching Gmail accounts might be a hassle, but Gmail supports **unlimited aliases**, allowing you to use a single email address to register multiple times. This is a simpler “free access” method.

### Method Overview:

- Gmail allows you to create aliases by adding a "+" symbol in your email address. For example:  
  - If your email address is `mygmail@gmail.com`, you can use `mygmail+cursor1@gmail.com`, `mygmail+cursor2@gmail.com`, and so on to register for Cursor.
  - Gmail will treat these as different email addresses, but all emails will be forwarded to `mygmail@gmail.com`.
  - This way, you can register multiple times and receive multiple free trials.

### Note:
- The "+" symbol and the subsequent text are part of the email address, allowing you to create as many aliases as you like.

## Cursor + DeepSeek Budget-Friendly Pairing

**DeepSeek** is another powerful model that is priced quite affordably. Its programming capabilities rival GPT-4, and it can be paired with Cursor to provide additional AI assistance in your development work.

## Conclusion

As mentioned earlier, while it is possible to use free methods to access Cursor Pro, we encourage everyone to purchase a paid subscription when possible. Supporting good software is important, and purchasing the Pro or Business plan helps ensure developers can continue to improve the software and provide better services.

It’s important to use free resources responsibly and support developers who build the tools we rely on. Your support helps them improve and innovate, ultimately benefiting everyone. We hope this article helps you understand how to leverage Cursor and other tools to enhance your development productivity.
